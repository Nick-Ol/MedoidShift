# MedoidShift and Quickshift algorithms

Implementation in Python. The syntax is inspired from scikit-learn clustering algorithms such as Meanshift.

## Medoidshift

Algorithm based on the article Mode-seeking by Medoidshifts, written by Y. A. Sheikh, E. A. Khan and T. Kanade in 2007
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaser/ModeSeekingByMedoidShifts_SheikhKhanKanade2007.pdf).

## Quickshift

Algorithm based on the article Quick Shift and Kernel Methods
for Mode Seeking, written by A. Vedaldi and S. Soatto in 2008
(http://vision.cs.ucla.edu/papers/vedaldiS08quick.pdf).
